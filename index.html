				This specification defines a bootstrap mechanism for creating, binding and connecting WebSocket peers together on a local machine or on a local network that share the same service name. Named WebSockets can be created from both web applications and native applications to create communications bridges between and among themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				This specification introduces the <a><code>LocalWebSocket</code></a> and <a><code>NetworkWebSocket</code></a> interfaces and the algorithms required to create, bind, advertise and discover other WebSocket peers on the local machine and the local network.
			</p>
			<p>
				By enabling different peers on local machines and local networks to discover and connect with each other we enable new sharing channels to be established. The following diagram illustrates some of the high-level sharing enabled by Named WebSockets.

				Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
				unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
				discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
				incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
				specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
				phase should <a href="https://github.com/namedwebsockets/spec/issues">subscribe
				to the repository on GitHub</a> and take part in the discussions.

			<h2>Use cases and requirements</h2>

			<p>Named WebSockets are useful in a variety of collaborative local device and local network scenarios:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Discover matching peer services on the local device and/or the local network.</li>
				<li>Create full-duplex communications channels between native applications and web applications.</li>
				<li>Create full-duplex communication channels between web pages hosted on different domains.</li>
				<li>Create initial local session signalling channels for establishing P2P sessions (via e.g. [WebRTC](#examples)).</li>
				<li>Create low latency local network multiplayer signalling channels for games.</li>
				<li>Enable collaborative editing, sharing and other forms of communication between web pages and applications on the local device and/or the local network.</li>
			</ul>

		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Conformance</h2>

			<p>
				Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or
				"return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must", "should",
				"may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements
				are to be interpreted as requirements on user agents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps MAY be implemented in any manner, so long as
				the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
				easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The only conformance class defined by this specification is a <dfn>user agent</dfn>.
			</p>
			<p>
				User agents MAY impose implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g. to prevent denial
				of service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.
			</p>
			<p>
				When support for a feature is disabled (e.g. as an emergency measure to mitigate a security problem, or to aid
				in development, or for performance reasons), user agents MUST act as if they had no support for the feature
				whatsoever, and as if the feature was not mentioned in this specification. For example, if a particular feature
				is accessed via an attribute in a Web IDL interface, the attribute itself would be omitted from the objects
				that implement that interface - leaving the attribute on the object but making it return null or throw an
				exception is insufficient.

				<h3>Dependencies</h3>

				<p>
					This specification relies on other underlying specifications:

        <dl>
          <dt>
            The WebSocket API
          </dt>
          <dd>
						The interfaces introduced in this specification are required to implement the WebSocket API. [[!websockets]]

			<h2>Terminology</h2>

			<p>
				The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where <code>Foo</code> is actually an interface, is sometimes
				used instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the interface <code>Foo</code>".
			</p>
			<p>
				The term DOM is used to refer to the API set made available to scripts in Web applications, and does not
				necessarily imply the existence of an actual <code>Document</code> object or of any other <code>Node</code>
				objects as defined in the DOM Core specifications. [[!DOM4]]
			</p>
			<p>
				An IDL attribute is said to be <em>getting</em> when its value is being retrieved (e.g. by author script), and
				is said to be <em>setting</em> when a new value is assigned to it.
			</p>

			<p>
				A <dfn>valid channel name</dfn> is a string used to federate peers that contains from 3 to 128 Unicode characters
        in the ranges U+002D to U+002E, U+0030 to U+0039, U+0041 to U+005A, U+005F, U+0061 to U+007A.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <dfn>local multicast address</dfn> is a UDP socket bound to both the IPv4 loopback address <code>127.0.0.1:5352</code> and the IPv6 loopback address <code>[::1]:5352</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <dfn>network multicast address</dfn> is a UDP socket bound to both the IPv4 address <code>224.0.0.251:5353</code> and the IPv6 address <code>[FF02::FB]:5353</code> (also known as the standard [[!MDNS]] listener endpoints).
			</p>

			<p>
				A <a>user agent</a> MUST listen for new Named WebSocket DNS-SD [[!DNS-SD]] broadcasts from other <a title="user agent">user agents</a> on both the <a>local multicast address</a> and the <a>network multicast address</a>. Additionally, a <a>user agent</a> MUST managing the advertising of locally-created Named WebSockets objects via [[!DNS-SD]] from a random locally-bound port toward either the <a>local multicast address</a> or the <a>network multicast address</a> according to the algorithms defined in this specification.
			</p>

			<p class="note">
				All implementations MUST use the <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> and <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> options so all
				<a title="user agent">user agents</a> are able to bind to the same <a>local multicast address</a> and <a>network multicast address</a>. Additional guidelines to avoid conflicts between multiple mDNS responders running on the same machine are provided and MUST be followed by implementations from <a class="externalDFN" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762#page-43">Considerations for Multiple Responders on the Same Machine</a>. [[!MDNS]]
			</p>

			<p>
				A <dfn>local WebSocket URL</dfn> is a standard WebSocket URL with a <var>scheme</var> of <code>ws</code>, a <var>host</var> of <code>localhost</code>, a <var>port</var> and a <var>path</var> component that identifies a single peer registered or discovered on the <a>local multicast address</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				A <dfn>network WebSocket URL</dfn> is a standard WebSocket URL with a <var>scheme</var> of <code>ws</code>, a <var>host</var> corresponding to a resolvable host name on the local network, a <var>port</var> and a <var>path</var> component that identifes a single peer registered or discovered on the <a>network multicast address</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <dfn>list of active local WebSockets</dfn> is a dynamic list that contains active <code>LocalWebSocket</code> objects created by the <a>user agent</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <dfn>list of active network WebSockets</dfn> is a dynamic list that contains active <code>NetworkWebSocket</code> objects created by the <a>user agent</a>.
			</p>

			<p>Each Named WebSocket object (a <code>LocalWebSocket</code> object or a <code>NetworkWebSocket</code> object) has its own <dfn>peer list</dfn> that tracks WebSocket connections from itself to remote Named WebSocket peers.</p>

			<p>
				The <dfn>local broadcast list</dfn> is a dynamic map of channel name to zero or more peer <code>WebSocket</code> connections. When a new Named WebSocket service is detected on the <a>local multicast address</a> then it will be added to this list.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <dfn>network broadcast list</dfn> is a dynamic map of channel name to zero or more peer <code>WebSocket</code> connections. When a new Named WebSocket service is detected on the <a>network multicast address</a> then it will be added to this list.

					Peer binding

				<p>The <a>user agent</a> MUST allow remote peers to establish WebSocket connections based on the services that it currently manages.</p>

				<p>
					When a new incoming WebSocket connection is established from a remote peer that has independently <a href="#peer-discovery">discovered a peer service running on the current user agent</a> then the <a>user agent</a> MUST run the following steps.
				</p>

				<ol class="rule">

						<li>Parse <var>local peer id</var> from the URL used to establish <var>server WebSocket</var>.</li>

			<h2>
				Message routing
			</h2>

			<p>
				When a new Named WebSocket is created via the <code>LocalWebSocket()</code> or <code>NetworkWebSocket()</code> constructors the resulting object MUST act as a broadcast channel toward all peer WebSocket connections contained in either the <a>local broadcast list</a> or the <a>network broadcast list</a>, as appropriate, that share the same <a>valid channel name</a>. Thus, if <code>send()</code> is called on a Named WebSocket object then the <a>user agent</a> MUST relay the sent message toward all matching broadcast WebSocket connections in the appropriate broadcast list. All broadcast WebSocket connections other than the sender MUST receive the sent message, by emitting a standard WebSocket <code>message</code> event against the broadcast WebSocket object (either a <code>LocalWebSocket</code> or <code>NetworkWebSocket</code> object).
